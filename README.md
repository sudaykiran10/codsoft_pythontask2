In this Python internship project, a password generator was created using PySimpleGUI, incorporating key concepts such as the `random` and `string` modules for secure password generation. The graphical user interface (GUI) design focused on user-friendly layouts, event-driven programming, and input handling, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience. The project demonstrated practical skills in GUI development, password generation algorithms, and effective window management, providing valuable insights into both functionality and user interface design.
